CITY ANIMALS: Rodents pack
by Duaelist Studios

Four furry dwellers are modeled, coloured, bumped and animated in this urban animals pack: raccoon, skunk, squirrel and mouse. To see a demo of all the animations (like in the Unity store page), open the cityAnimalsRodentsDemo scene.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

The raccoon, skunk and mouse comes with the following animation clip names:
- walk: loopable walk animation
- run: loopable run animation
- idleLoop: loopable idle animation
- walkToRun: fast transition from walk stance to run pose
- runToWalk: fast transition from run stance to walk pose
- idleStart: transition from walk stance to idle pose
- idleEnd: transition from idle stance to walk pose
- death: death animation from walk pose

The squirrel has mostly loopable animations since everything starts and ends in the same pose:
- walk: loopable walk animati1on
- run: loopable run animation
- idle: loopable idle animation
- death: death animation

The models are low-poly .fbx files with corresponding sets of materials for both the eyes and body.

Polycount (in tri's):
Raccoon - 512
Skunk - 494
Squirrel - 680
Mouse - 526

Textures are by default 512x512, but they work down to 128x128. Any lower and it's a bit muddy. Every model comes with a color map and a normal map.

To use, click GameObject->Import Package->Custom Package, select the cityAnimalsRodents package to import the files. Once imported, drag and drop the raccoon, skunk, squirrel or mouse game objects from the cityAnimalsRodents folder into your scene. By default they will play all the animations, but you can select the animation clips through Unity.
